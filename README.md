# Example project to get started with puppeteer

To get started, clone this repository or download the code, then run

```
npm install
```

in the project directory.

To run the script, run

```
node index.js
```

in the project directory.

This should create two files, `screenshot.png` and `headlines.txt` in the project directory, and output the text of all headlines on the page to the console.

See comments in index.js for further explanation.
